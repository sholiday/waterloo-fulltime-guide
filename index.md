This is a collection of things we wished someone told us when we went away for fulltime opportunities
in the US. We hope it helps you out. Many things contained in this document were

### Applying to Jobs

If you're a graduating co-op student, attending Waterloo or elsewhere, you already know how this works, for the most part.
Here are a few quick resource refreshers for finding awesome companies to work at.

* [AngelList](https://angel.co) - AngelList has a wealth of early to late-stage (well-funded) startups that are always looking for talent. Post a talent profile and search for that full-time job.
* [LinkedIn Premium](https://premium.linkedin.com) - LinkedIn itself already has some great tools; adding a premium search functionality to that experience can only enhance your search.

Note that even as a co-op student, it can take a while (up to a few months) to find a full-time position if you end up not returning to a previous employer, for whatever reason.
Keep applying, keep learning, keep trying - persistence and confidence is key. You will find a job in time - everyone does, in some way or another.

General tips & advice:

* Unlike your previous co-op experiences, your employers (outside of JobMine) don't look at your grades or previous co-op evaluations. If your resume is solid, you will likely get a shot for an interview.
* Since the above point should be further emphasized: **Interview performance is the key deciding factor**
  * Getting an interview will be different than JobMine; generally, you respond directly to the recruiter, and you schedule everything well in advance.
  * Most interviews for companies outside of your home city will be phone or voice (Skype, GVoice, etc) interviews. If it's for a technical position, be prepared to code.

### Negotiation

Always negotiate. For many of us it's hard to negotiate because the offers are
often quite lucrative. It can seem like more than we deserve. But if you don't
negotiate you can be leaving [a lot of money on the table][negotiating-cost].

[negotiating-cost]: http://lifehacker.com/5968375/not-negotiating-your-starting-salary-could-cost-you-500000)

If having more money to save for a house or family isn't enough of a motivator,
there are [other reasons][other-reasons-nego] to negotiate.

[other-reasons-nego]: http://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-never-be-afraid-to-negotiate-a-higher-sa-1477953403

Part of the problem with negotiating a salary is the information imbalance.
Recruiters know the going rate for a Software Engineer from Waterloo. So ask
your friends and classmates from upper years to share their offer details if
they are comfortable. We tend to treat salary as taboo. This makes sense most of
the time, but for our first full-time job we are all in generally the same boat.
So don't be afraid to ask a friend, they will often be happy to help.

Recruiters are really good at negotiation and scaring people into accepting.
Stephen has had friends that just took the first offer given over the phone and
friends who have given into the pressure of an 'exploding offer.' Joel Spolsky
of StackOverflow fame has written
[a nice article on exploding offers][exploding-offers].

[exploding-offers]: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/11/26.html

Turns out, that while the recruiter may pressure you with a deadline, they will
happily extend it. If the company decided to make you an offer, they are
probably pretty serious about trying to hire you. They'll let you take a few
weeks if you give them a good reason. Stephen's friends pushed back return offers
for over 3 months.

The easiest way to negotiate is to have other competing offers. Once you get the
details of a company's offer, tell them what the other companies have offered you.
Don't lie, often they will ask you to forward the offer letter for verification.

Many recruiters get a bonus or have their bonus tied to the number of new hires
they sign. This means that they are somewhat on your side when it comes to
making you happy. However, they are handling a lot of other candidates so don't
waste their time. Be direct and clear with what you want. Don't make them guess.
And be polite, obviously.

When it gets towards the end of the negotiation, and you know which company you
prefer, let the recruiter know that you will sign today if x number is y
(20,000 RSUs).

Some numbers are harder to negotiate than others. At least in 2014, salary was
hard to negotiate for a lot of the larger companies for many people. The easiest
to change seemed to be signing bonus, equity and relocation bonus.

Some benefits to consider:

* 401k
* Signing bonus
* Relocation bonus
* Annual bonuses (mostly large companies)
* Vacation time

<section id="TN" />
### TN
If you are a Canadian citizen, your employer will likely set you up with a TN
visa. This is a pretty easy process. You will apply at the border so leave some
extra time (15 minutes for the actual application and an hour for the extra
wait). Stephen knows someone who missed their flight due to the wait for
secondary.

If you are crossing by land, Stephen knows someone who couldn't get their TN
simply because the guard who processes TNs wasn't there. Not sure if this is
common, but something to look into.

<section id="H1-B" />
### H1-B
A common visa for non-Canadians. Only 65,000 per year are given out every year,
with an extra 20,000 cap being extended to people with Master's degrees or
higher. The application process begins in April of every year, and is basically
a lottery system. Anyone who is reapplying from the previous year has the same
chance of obtaining their H1-B as a new applicant. More details can be found on
the [USCIS website][h1-uscis].
